crossplatform-adventurecraft
============================

__Put .minecraft in your .gitignore! It is illegal to include the .minecraft folder as it allows users to play without
purchasing the game.__

This is a adventurecraft installation that can be used on more than one OS at once, which makes it useful for collaborating on a project.
To run, launch the shell file corresponding to your operating system. 64-bit operating systems have a 64 after the OS name, while 32-bit 
operating systems have a 32 after the OS name.  

##Installing
Adventurecraft has not been updated recently, so the installer expects Minecraft version 1.3 or lower. To fix this,
you can download the minecraft.jar for Minecraft 1.3. Put it in the bin directory of your Minecraft install directory.  
It will be:  
* %APPDATA%/.minecraft/ on Windows
* ~/Library/Application Support on OSX
* ~/.minecraft on Linux  

After you do this, start Minecraft to let it update to the new jarfile, then close Minecraft. Use the launcher script
that corresponds to your OS, then tell Adventurecraft to install from your minecraft install directory.
